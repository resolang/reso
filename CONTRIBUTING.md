# Contribution guidelines

1. Commit messages should at least maintain the `<type>: <description>` from [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). 

2. Unit tests are not optional. Please add or update tests, and all `cargo test` should pass.

3. Right now, this is a one-person project, so I don't have a lot of heavy expectations! I do appreciate contributions and I don't have a lot of experience running a project. Please feel free to raise an issue or reach out to me directly on GitHub, GitLab, or [by contacting me directly](https://lynndotpy.xyz/about/).
