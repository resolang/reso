I'm not the first person to come up with the idea of an executable, drawn-circuit! 

- Mentioned above, `ashirviskas` [made a Rust implementation](https://github.com/ashirviskas/rust_reso/) too!
- Various cellular automata are Turing complete and can be used to build a processor.
  - [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) -- A Turing-complete zero-player-game. By far the most popular cellular automata. Rest in Peace John Conway.
  - [Wireworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld) -- Another cellular automata in which it is easy to implement logic circuits.
  - [Brian's Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%27s_Brain) -- A cellular automaton similar to the previous.
- [Bitmap Logic Simulator](https://realhet.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/bitmap-logic-simulator/) -- I'm not sure how this works, but check it out! It's a similar idea.
- [Turing Paint](https://byronknoll.com/turing.html) and [Doodle Code](https://byronknoll.com/doodle.html), which have a similar idea of "doodle-able logic circuits".
- [Wired Logic](https://github.com/martinkirsche/wired-logic), similar to wire-world, simulating circuits in an image.
- Lots of games:
  - [Minecraft](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Redstone_circuits) especially for **redstone**, an in-game resource that lets you build circuits.
  - [Zacktronics](https://www.zachtronics.com/), known for games which focus heavily on computation.
  - Hempuli is one of my favorite game devs, and seeing their development on [Baba Is You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Is_You) kept my brain on the right track for this.
  - [This in-browser videogame](https://github.com/martinkirsche/wired-logic) that has you build circuits and solve problems.


## Projects with a similar name

Reso was influenced by redstone, esolangs, and Python. The goal was to make digital logic circuits that could be built by anybody who can use MS Paint.

- [The Real Estate Standards Organization](https://www.reso.org/), which is completely unrelated to this.
- [18kimn/Reso](https://github.com/18kimn/reso), an unrelated project which turns R into an esoteric language.
